Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development
and connecting the code version to the results is critical for
reproducibility.

<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version
<a href="https://github.com/han16/Collaborations/tree/0c5746043a6f7290af42030e07044f74605eeba0" target="_blank">0c57460</a>.
See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made
to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for
the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results
(you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or
<code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown
file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it
depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results
were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    analysis/.Rhistory

Unstaged changes:
    Modified:   analysis/2022_Sep1_Juan.Rmd

</code></pre>
<p>
Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not
included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to
have uncommitted changes.

the presentation more consistent at the cost of the webpage sometimes
taking slightly longer to load. Note that this only works because the
footer is added to webpages before the MathJax javascript. -->
